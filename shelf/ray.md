Hard to stay sane.

So much in my head it's hard to stay sane... 
The next person might have it worse so I try not to complain... 

In a world where even she who smiles can't tell if her smile is real or fake... 

Still I find pleasure in life's endless possibilities, in the bittersweet naughtiness, and in everything that makes me Rayâ€¦
