## make-believe

thoughts imaginary   
i pull out   
of my magic black hat   
with a rabid white rabbit   

there is no   
saving me   
from make-believe

## assay

often, and with care   
without reflection   
or a drop of fear   

never ignorant   
getting goals accomplished   
evaluate all   
regardless of where

## a-levels

i dropped out to focus   
and study more   
and mentally soar   

you knock on the door   
for the encore   
i fly, for the high   

i never sleep   
for in the heavens   
you cannot snore

mo' monkey biz

## other poets

are better than me   
simpler, you see   
free as can be   

with regard to myself,    
i know   
- this is catharsis   
- this has no rhyme
my depth is shallow at best

#### trust

is a seed   
that does   
not just grow   

first you sow   
then you mend   

**_on and on_**   
**_without end_**   

i will give   
you will take   
just do not   

pretend   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### desire

come at me always   
with the heat   
of pure fire   

never relent   
in loving   
and i too   
will never   
in adoring   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### want me

its not complex   
truly simple   
you and me

want and need   
_not me indeed_   

but the passion   
you and i   
know i breed   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### reflect

on the way   
you once did walk   
before i passed   
you my cross   

blanched as chalk   
is my soul   
with a center   
full of **melanin**

- - - 

## impatient

i tire   
of waiting   

of skating   
on the fence

of relating   
with pagans   

**_full of pretence_**

## bitter blunt

you sting   
and whisper   
a tale of death   

but im not coughing   
but im not choking   
i accept it

lets do nothing   
just because   

life is a game   
you catch   
and toss

## mean

do not like me   
if you wish   
that does not matter   

just do not speak   
behind my back   
i hear your chatter   

i taste sweet   
ask your soul   
i am a honeyed black adder

## darling

come to me

a stranger asked   
"are you okay?"

with me by day

leave me this way

#### batman

i am alone      
that ought not    
to be stated    

yet i save    
those i can    
from falling    

i am no saint    
yet still,    
half-martyred

#### the punisher

guerrilla warrior   
sweeper of deceit   

nothing poetic   
breathing crooked   
pure artistry   

anger is a weapon   
i know too well

#### john constantine

chain smoker   
my pain is hidden     
in a box   

demon caller   
i know my faults   

not worthy of a lover   
i lie to all   
leave me be

#### catwoman

independent    
broken    
independent    

all in turns    
no pain burns    

walk on edges    
fly off rooftops    
all to run away    
from love

## bye

true poetry   
they do not  
feel your truth  

true love  
they do not  
want your warmth  

true peace  
they do not  
seek your girth

## del ray

_lana knows my soul_

i think  
i cannot know

she breathes  
pure gold  
yet wants nothing

could love not be  
direct as smoke  

straight as a tree  
other than  
full of glee  

why do we  
claim we know  
what we do not

## lack of

the absence    
of sleep    
means not  
insomnia  

the lack   
of love  
means not   
loneliness  

nothing can  
fill a thing  
that is nothing

## cold poetry

look not    
into my eyes    
_i cannot look back_     

look not    
into my soul    
_its kind of wack_  

my poems  
hardly rhyme nowadays  
_now thats a fact_

## do not

- - -

do not look  
do not see  
do not feel  
do not speak  

_understand_  
_there is no point_  

do not love  
do not hug  
do not smile  
do not reach  

_understand_  
_there is no point_  

do not wonder  
do not ask  
do not bother  
do not sigh

## CONFESSIONS

- - -

#### no one can

see this  
so  
i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### understand

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - - 

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
