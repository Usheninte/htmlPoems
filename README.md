## PROGNOSIS

#### 1.intro

welcome to the jungle  
the dogs are on patrol

all they know  
is to whisper and mumble  
i watch their lies, fly and tumble  

&copy; POETRIQUE

#### 2. hall politics

whilst the drunken  
breathe, and feel they rule  

the workers of the state  
effect and machinate  
schemes and plans  

that condemn the lost  

&copy; POETRIQUE

#### 3. persona

hide yourself  
no one wants to see  

your soul's face  
your pretense at taste  

your quaking, breaking mind  
or the heart you left to waste  

&copy; POETRIQUE

#### 4. blind mob

they move and sway  
to the chaos of life    

they know no law  
thus have no flaw,   

have learnt  
to feed and fight    
with the claw  

&copy; POETRIQUE

#### 5. batteries

ak47 batteries  
recharge 'em, recharge 'em  

release their vacant souls  
like torpedoes  
into the wishful eyes  
of the weak

## UNCAPITALIZED

#### 1

stiff  
is the  
mind.  
when, not  
at peace

#### 2

i licked flame  
what am i?  

he made me, to do more  
how can i?  

each day a new  
feather springs  
will i fly?

#### 3

i  
want to fall  
out of the sky  

but i  
do not want  
to die

#### 4

carpe noctem  
carpe vinum  
seize the night  
and wine, in time  

i am more  
a man of the pipe  
i breathe my thoughts  

&copy; POETRIQUE

#### 5

**_virgin thoughts_**

fvcked me  
a cocktail bytch  
last night  

but i am  
a straight  
vodka man

&copy; POETRIQUE

#### 6

i do not  
know who i  
must be  

to be  
who i know  
that i am
