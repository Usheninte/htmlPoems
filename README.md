## CONFESSIONS

#### no one can

see this  
so  
i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul

#### understand

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to think

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
