## bye

true poetry   
they do not  
feel your truth  

true love  
they do not  
want your warmth  

true peace  
they do not  
seek your girth

## del ray

_lana knows my soul_  

i guess  
i think  
i cannot know  

_lana knows my soul_  

she breathes  
pure gold  
yet wants nothing  

_lana knows my soul_

## simple

could love not be  
direct as smoke  

straight as a tree  
other than  
full of glee  

why do we  
claim we know  
what we do not

## lack of

the absence    
of sleep    
means not  
insomnia  

the lack   
of love  
means not   
loneliness  

nothing can  
fill a thing  
that is nothing

## cold poetry

look not    
into my eyes    
_i cannot look back_     

look not    
into my soul    
_its kind of wack_  

my poems  
hardly rhyme nowadays  
_now thats a fact_

## do not

- - -

do not look  
do not see  
do not feel  
do not speak  

_understand_  
_there is no point_  

do not love  
do not hug  
do not smile  
do not reach  

_understand_  
_there is no point_  

do not wonder  
do not ask  
do not bother  
do not sigh

## CONFESSIONS

- - -

#### no one can

see this  
so  
i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### understand

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
