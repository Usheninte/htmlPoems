## save me

no one at all       
i desire nothing now      
but to bask     
in the silence of my sin      
what say you      
will you come too ...

## fool no more

i am a fool no more         
life is cool no more        
i stare at reality        
angry and calm        

i count my sins       
they climb up to the stars.       
nothing soothes       
no one can choose       
the darkness of their soul        

momma wants me to be holy       
poppa just wants me to be         
yet he is never around me       

there is no one to ease       
i seek no longer to please

why should i      
i am too weak to cry       
how could i

when in truth       
i am a prophet

## pointless

do not fight        
the demons that you see       
the pain within your soul       
your sorrows turned to joy      
the world is just too cold        

do not fight        
the love you know to doubt        
whisper and then shout        
the gods are too asleep       
to help you out         

do not fight        
who you know you are        
you could be a star       
or a blackhole        
either way, you are in the sky        

do not fight        
what helps you remember       
you are made of gold        
who cares if no one cares        
wipe away your tears        

do not fight        
the colours on your soul        
the red that proves you are bloody        
the black that is your mind       
the green that is your flag       

do not fight        
the pointlessness of life       
there is no rhythm to reality       
no one will sing your song        
till you claim it is your anthem

the last cloud

## SILLY THOUGHTS 

Sometimes I feel invisible or like      
I exist only in someone's subconscious.       

Like, what if I'm not real        
I mean, what if I'm just a part         
of someone's reality.       
Or what if this is just         
someone's nightmare, Because        
I'm definitely not living a dream.        

I mean, I know for sure         
there could be infinite alternate realities        
to every reality.       

My reality isn't convincing enough.

## emotions

#### my reality

it takes an insect     
in my eye to make me _weep_      

and a prescribed pill
to make me **sleep**

i gamble with machinations     
foster calculations     
just so, i do not feel like **_sheep_**

#### queen

i knew her for half a second    
that was enough     
she is the last    
in a recent rapid succession

to ignore my love     
and my soul rebuff

she had a     
rapid fire spirit     
bright as the sun, was she ...     
she was my new religion     
i stood at her pulpit     

**_now i know_**     
**_i can never serve_**     
**_the god king of love_**

#### nerd for life

i have used up     
two blue ink pens     
during these exams     

of life: reality tutors me     
i obey my teacher alone     
i cannot stop      

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### nothing changes

i made my lips sweet     
for a _convo_ that never held     

for a spluttering sparrow     
of a bird     
to become in a triangle     
an unwilling third     

i still cannot share my love

#### good night

nothing can improve     
for a star-crossed poet

my pain must turn to profit

exposed to the sun   
naked like a maiden

## the show

we are on the waves    
surfing, but never drowning    
screaming but never shouting    
speaking from our souls   

we keep it simple    
open and unspoken    
moving agendas,    
shinying shields, and blades   
mental precision   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

on the steady   
clearly ready   
nothing bloddy   
dirty logic   

we are the new scientists   
ancient like kings   
postmodern relics   

we are the new preachers   
teaching the soft religion   
moving like ghosts   
walking like wolves   
we are the new magicians   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

we know all our brothers   
we rock all the borders   
we are up in the air   
like bluebirds    

of all the cool faces   
we make up two-thirds   
we are aiming for greatness    
we do what we want to     
there is nothing holding us back

## explain

why can i never    
relay as in ink   
my words, in person - sharper   

the faults i feel i have

never bother   
the humble and shy   
are not oft recalled

## who i need to be

#### a man 

first and foremost   
thus, i need a companion   

no one can truly breathe alone   

teach me to roam    
across the brightest part   
of Hades' sky    

so i can be the one for you   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### love galore

i can be loyal     
i need someone   
to be so for   

leave me when you feel    
nothing again   
do not just drift   
like golden dust, again   
let me know - **then**

#### chocolates

keep you joyful   
but i   
have no sweet tooth   
even if, the first soul   
i ever brushed was a gem   

melt upon me   
sigh atop me   
keep it simple   
blunt and free

#### deaf man words

you might not like   
my ways, my sayings

## last page 

no more stories

it is unentertaining       
how often   
i have fallen    

**_one last hurrah_**

## what i have to say

- - -

#### for now

the pain is a game   
a two minute race   
without face   
without pace   

its a mental mirage   
that burns from within   
it soothes too, i must confess   

herein lies the truth   
of my pathetic sin   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### barsman

i burn bars   
not for ectasy   

but to reclaim    
the key to reality    
my once sober clarity   
my weak hold on vanity   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### better already

do i swim or wade through life   
seek out bitter, endless strife   

neither in truth   
i drown each day     

**_in the pool_**   
**_of my mind's tear_**  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

## make-believe

thoughts imaginary   
i pull out   
of my magic black hat   
with a rabid white rabbit   

there is no   
saving me   
from make-believe

for a season
